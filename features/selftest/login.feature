  As a tester
  I need to prove that behat testing works.

  Scenario: Create and log in as a user
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "authenticated user" role
    When I click "My account"
    Then I should see the heading "History"

  Scenario: Test that blackbox login works
    Given I am logged in as "dummy" with password "dummy"
    When I click "My account"
    Then I should see the heading "History"
